## WHAT IS DRUPAL?

---

"Drupal is a completely flexible system for building web based solutions.

It provides many layers that can be leveraged - from providing high level turn key solutions to low level code libraries and storage backend management. Drupal isn't tied to any delivery channel - it can provide the backend for a Voice UI such as Amazon Alexa, drive a digital signage system such as the New York city subway or drive multiple websites at once (e.g. govCMS used by the Australia Government). Everything is flexible, everything is customisable, down to every line of code. Drupal is an Open Source system and every day more functionality is being developed that is available to all."
